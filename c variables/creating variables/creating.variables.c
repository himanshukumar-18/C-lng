/* Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters.

In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Characters are surrounded by single quotes */

/*
syntax
type variablesName = value;
*/



// example
// Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign the value:

// int myNum = 01;



// You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:

// int myName;
// myName = "Himanshu Kumar";
